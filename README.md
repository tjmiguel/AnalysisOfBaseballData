# AnalysisOfBaseballData

This repository contains an analysis of baseball hall of fame data. 

In this repo you will find an R script for a decision tree analysis used to predict whether or not a player would get inducted into the hall of fame. Additionally, you will find an R script for a logistic tree analysis to confirm the results and compare the two models. 

Lastly, you will find 2 data sets, seperated by Batters and Pitchers, used to do the analysis. The intial zip file of all the baseball data is also attached.

There are extentions to this analysis that give reason for the model and tighten up a bit of the assumptions in the model. These will be added at a later date.

Enjoy.
